# Free WebVR For Quest
_Submit your WebVR link for Quest here. And let's user know that your game exist._

As Oculus Team is strict about game on the Store developers try to find solutions.
Some of them are starting to make WebVR games to counter this situaton.

As a respond to this, I propose to build a free WebVR catalogue on the Quest.


## You are a Quest User

1. Unlock developer mode on your phone (See how to [here](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryday/issues/28))
2. Sideload the [WebVR Quest Book](#) on the Quest (See how to [here](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryday/issues/10))
3. Launch the application on the Quest and select the game you want to play.

## You are a game creator

1. Fork the project
2. Modify the [catalog file] with your game info
3. Make a Pull Request.https://github.com/EloiStree/FreeWebVRForQuest
4. Wait that an administrator of this group accept the Pull. 
5. There is almost no filter here, just the time to check that your json modification is valide

PS: Later some filter tags for:
- Kid, Porn, Danger... will be add.

## You want to be administrator of the Catalog

Feel free to contact us (me for the  moment).

## You want to make a better application

Fork the project and do a better version.
Or feel free to contact us (me for the  moment).


# Why I am doing that ?
I am not doing that for money.   
I just want to help people to enjoy the Quest.   

But if you want to access my other tool.   
Or if you want to offer me a beer.
