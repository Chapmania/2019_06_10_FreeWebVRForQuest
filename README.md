# Free WebVR For Quest
_Submit your WebVR link for Quest here. And let's user know that your game exist._

As Oculus Team is strict about game on the Store developers try to find solutions.   
Some of them are starting to make WebVR games to counter this situaton.   

As a respond to this, I propose to build a free WebVR catalogue on the Quest.   


## You are a Quest User

1. Unlock developer mode on your phone (See how to [here](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryday/issues/28))
2. Sideload the [WebVR Quest Book](#) on the Quest (See how to [here](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryday/issues/10))
3. Launch the application on the Quest and select the game you want to play.
### You are a user and you find a web vr game ?
If you know how to fork.   
Feel free to add the game and Pull the modification.   

Else, you can add it to the [Issue](https://github.com/EloiStree/FreeWebVRForQuest/issues) of this project.   
Administrators will add it as soon as they are availaible.    


## You are a game creator

1. Fork the project
2. Modify the [catalog file] with your game info
3. Make a Pull Request.https://github.com/EloiStree/FreeWebVRForQuest
4. Wait that an administrator of this group accept the Pull. 
5. There is almost no filter here, just the time to check that your json modification is valide

## You want to be administrator of the Catalog

Feel free to contact us (me for the  moment).

## You want to make a better application

Send me your mail address. 
I will add you to the open/private project to fork.
https://github.com/EloiStree/FreeWebVRForQuestProject

It is an open project.
But as I am using bought asset from the store,
I can let's the project public.

Fork the project, when I added you, and do a better version.


# Why I am doing that ?
I am not doing that for money.   
I just want to help people to enjoy the Quest.   

But if you want to access my other tool.   
Or if you want to offer me a beer.
